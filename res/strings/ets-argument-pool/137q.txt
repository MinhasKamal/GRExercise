The citizens of Forsythe have adopted more healthful lifestyles. Their responses to a recent survey show that in their eating habits they conform more closely to government nutritional recommendations than they did ten years ago.

This trend is also evident in reduced sales of sulia, a food that few of the healthiest citizens regularly eat.
